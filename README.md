### Aim

In the initial stage of the project, our objective is to create visual representations of supplier sales data and establish a method for evaluating the environmental sustainability of each supplier. To accomplish this, we are utilizing carbon ratings as a key metric. These carbon ratings, as well as carbon footprint calculations, are derived from specific [factors](https://justenergy.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-carbon-footprint/). Additionally, we have developed comprehensive visualizations of supplier sales data categorized by Region, Market, and Cities for a more detailed analysis.
